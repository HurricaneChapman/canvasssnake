# CANVASSSNAKE
Currently this is a barebones, vanilla ES6+ javascript w/ HTML5 Canvas implementation of the classic Snake game, coded in about 3-4 hours. I'd never done this sort of game before and was challenged to do so, so I did it.

It has no dependencies and doesn't need a webserver. Just load the html file and you're good to go.

## Controls
Use the arrow start the game by pushing start, then use arrow keys. Eat food, get bigger, avoid the walls. Your speed slowly increases as time goes by. You can dash by pressing the arrow keys in the direction you're currently going.

When you 'eat' yourself, you lose.
